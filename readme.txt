* For feature requests, please [contact us](https://www.prisna.net/contact-us/).

= Advantages over similar plugins: =
There are a number of Bing translation plugins in this great repository. However, most of them haven't been carefully built. Here's a list of reasons of why you should choose this plugin:

* All the settings are stored in only one record in the database; whilst other plugins use lots of records.
* It's the fastest as it doesn't load any external file; whilst other plugins load unnecessary javascript and css files.
* It includes all the options of the original [Bing Website Translator](https://www.bing.com/widget/translator); whilst other plugins offer just a restricted version.
* Prisna Ltd. is a real company ([register record](https://www.prisna.net/images/prisna-limited.pdf)), with professional people working on it.

= How can I exclude some parts from being translated? =
You should add the *notranslate* style class to the container HTML element. Or if you want to exclude just a piece of text, you should wrap it within a HTML element with the *notranslate* style class, for instance:

&lt;span class=&quot;notranslate&quot;&gt;Company name&lt;/span&gt;

= I have a lot of plugins, will this plugin slow down my website? =
This plugin has a lot of options for you to customize it in the best possible way. All these options are saved in only one database record (yes, only one!). So you can rest assured it won't slow down your website. Sometimes your website slows down when you use more and more plugins, because most likely they haven't been built carefully. If you have some understanding of code, you can search for the *add_option* function within your plugins files to check on this matter.

* Responding to questions or problems regarding the plugin and its features.
